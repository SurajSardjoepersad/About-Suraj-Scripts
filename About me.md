- 👋 Hi, My name is Suraj and i am a student at Nova College. I like learning new things when they are explained well and are challenging to do.
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming because off my dad. He works for the child Insurense department IT where you have to check in databases. He showed me a litte bit off how he programmes and talk to people in such an easy and fun way.

After this when i'm done i want to work somewhere in the security section off it. I find The back-end like JS(Javascript) intressting and i'm willing to learn more from it. I love to see how these secured things are made and make something for myself in the future.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Code Languages like PHP, PHP Admin, HTML, CSS, JS and NODE. I have also some experience from my last Internship with WordPress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with people who are open to share what they like and what they want. Somebody that has some knowledge in coding and has  somewhat off same path of intrest as me.
- 📫 You can send a E-mail if you wish you reach out to me! i'm looking forward to collaborate with u.
